# DarkThemePicker  
  
This project is a Dark Theme experiment, in order to show the combination of colours from `light` to `dark theme`.
There's a `colour picker` to change the colour setup in the entire app and a `Dark/Light theme switcher button` that recreates the Activity with the theme mode selected.
